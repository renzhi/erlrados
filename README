This project is an Erlang binding of the librados on Linux. It tried 
too bind the RADOS C API of the Ceph distributed object store as closely
as possible, while maintaining the Erlang semantics and idioms.

Note that this has been done for my own use, in my own projects. Therefore, 
I have only bound the functions that I needed at the moment. Not all functions
of the librados are done at this point.

This project compiles and runs only on Linux. No other platform is 
supported.

This has been tested on Linux 3.2.x, with Ceph 0.46-1 and Erlang R15B01.
